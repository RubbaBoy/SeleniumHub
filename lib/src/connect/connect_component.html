        This program is the webserver you are currently on to display instances, along with a backend API that proxies
        selenium instances that you connect to. For inspection, this program also has a WebSocket proxy for the
        instances the backend API gets. Currently this only is tested on chrome, though will most likely work for other
        browsers, just not inspection.

        To connect, you must be using selenium (no shit) on the JsonWire spec, and connect via whatever remote interface
        your API uses from the following URI:
    </p>
    <pre>
{{ host }}:{{ port }}/selenium/
    </pre>
    <p>
        The following are some examples of connecting with the server:

    <h2>Dart</h2>
    <p>Using the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/webdriver">webdriver</a> package</p>
    <pre>
var driver = await createDriver(uri: Uri.parse('http://{{ host }}:{{ port }}/selenium/'), spec: WebDriverSpec.JsonWire);
    </pre>

    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p>Using the <a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium/">Selenium</a> and
        <a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-chromium-driver/">Chromeium
            Driver</a> libraries</p>
    <pre>
var driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://{{ host }}:{{ port }}/selenium/"), new ChromeOptions());
